# INSURANCE COVERAGE AND USAGE ANALYSIS
1.	Project Background and Overview
________________________________________
Health insurance coverage and healthcare utilisation are critical indicators of public health and accessibility. This analysis explores the disparities and trends within a dataset representing a sample population of 6,158 records analysed. The findings aim to inform policies and strategies to improve healthcare access for underserved groups.
Key Metrics Tracked:
•	Percentage of individuals with health insurance.
•	Influence of employment and income on insurance access.
•	Hospital visit frequency differences between insured and uninsured individuals.
Objectives:
1.	Quantify the proportion of individuals with health insurance.
2.	Identify the socioeconomic factors influencing insurance coverage.
3.	Assess the impact of health insurance on hospital visit frequency.
By addressing these objectives, this analysis seeks to guide stakeholders in enhancing health insurance penetration and healthcare equity.
2. Executive Summary
________________________________________
1.	Insurance Coverage: 59% of the population is insured, while 41% lack coverage. Employment and income significantly influence these rates.
2.	Socioeconomic Disparities: Higher-income earners (90% insured) have significantly better coverage compared to low-income groups (35%).
3.	Healthcare Utilization: Insured individuals visit hospitals more frequently (average interval: 6 months) compared to the uninsured (7 months).
4.	Key Metrics: Proportion of insured individuals, socioeconomic impact on coverage, and healthcare utilisation trends.
