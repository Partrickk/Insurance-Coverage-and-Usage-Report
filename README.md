# INSURANCE COVERAGE AND USAGE ANALYSIS
1.	Project Background and Overview
________________________________________
Health insurance coverage and healthcare utilisation are critical indicators of public health and accessibility. This analysis explores the disparities and trends within a dataset representing a sample population of 6,158 records analysed. The findings aim to inform policies and strategies to improve healthcare access for underserved groups.
Key Metrics Tracked:
•	Percentage of individuals with health insurance.
•	Influence of employment and income on insurance access.
•	Hospital visit frequency differences between insured and uninsured individuals.
Objectives:
1.	Quantify the proportion of individuals with health insurance.
2.	Identify the socioeconomic factors influencing insurance coverage.
3.	Assess the impact of health insurance on hospital visit frequency.
By addressing these objectives, this analysis seeks to guide stakeholders in enhancing health insurance penetration and healthcare equity.
2. Executive Summary
________________________________________
1.	Insurance Coverage: 59% of the population is insured, while 41% lack coverage. Employment and income significantly influence these rates.
2.	Socioeconomic Disparities: Higher-income earners (90% insured) have significantly better coverage compared to low-income groups (35%).
3.	Healthcare Utilization: Insured individuals visit hospitals more frequently (average interval: 6 months) compared to the uninsured (7 months).
4.	Key Metrics: Proportion of insured individuals, socioeconomic impact on coverage, and healthcare utilisation trends.

Insight 1: Demographic Disparities in Health Insurance Coverage
Insurance Coverage by Demographics
 
•	Key Metric: 59% insured, with coverage rates varying by employment and income levels.
•	Implication: Vulnerable groups (unemployed, low-income) exhibit lower coverage, indicating a gap in accessibility.

Insight 2: Socioeconomic Impact on Insurance Access
Coverage by Employment and Income
 
 

•	Key Metric: Income correlates strongly with insurance rates (90% for high-income vs. 35% for low-income).
•	Implication: Subsidised health programs could address disparities among low-income groups.

Insight 3: Healthcare Utilization by Insurance Status
Hospital Visit Frequency by Insurance Status
		 

•	Key Metric: Insured individuals have shorter intervals between hospital visits (6 months vs. 7 months).
•	Implication: Insurance improves healthcare access and usage.
6.	Recommendations
________________________________________
1.	Targeted Subsidies:
o	Develop subsidised health insurance programs focused on low-income and unemployed groups.

6.	Caveats and Assumptions
________________________________________
1.	Data Limitations:
o	The dataset may not represent the entire population, potentially skewing results.
2.	Self-Reported Bias:
o	Variables like income and hospital visits are self-reported and may contain inaccuracies.
3.	Temporal Context:
o	The analysis reflects a specific period and may not capture ongoing trends.
4.	Unmeasured Variables:
o	Factors like regional healthcare policies and cultural differences were not accounted for.
